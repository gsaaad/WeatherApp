## Description

- The project's aim is to utilize API call from OpenWeather to allow users to look up the weather of their searched city and get weather information for that city.
- such information would include, Temperature, Wind speed, and Humidity levels, as well as a picture/icon representation of Sunny/Rain/Cloudy etc.
- While users have the ability to look up city weather, local storage will utlize that input and give them a saved copy of which cities they have looked up for easier useability~
